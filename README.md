# Pomodoro Study Companion

An AI-powered study companion that combines Pomodoro focus sessions with automatic flashcard generation to help students study more effectively using active recall and spaced repetition.

---

## Overview

Pomodoro Study Companion is a productivity and learning tool designed to help students stay focused while studying and retain information better.

Instead of just timing study sessions, the app actively supports learning by generating flashcards from study content and reinforcing key concepts over time.

## Features

### Pomodoro Timer
- Customizable focus and break intervals
- Session tracking for productivity insights

### Flashcard Generation
- Automatically generates flashcards from notes or text input
- Supports question–answer and definition-style cards

### Study Sessions
- Link flashcards to Pomodoro sessions
- Review cards during breaks or after sessions

### Spaced Repetition (Planned)
- Schedule flashcard reviews based on performance
- Prioritize difficult concepts

## Why This Project?

Many productivity apps focus only on time management, while many study apps focus only on content review. This project bridges both by:

- Encouraging deep focus
- Reinforcing learning with active recall
- Helping students study smarter, not longer

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Flask
- AI / NLP: Gemini API (for flashcard generation)

---

## Basic Workflow

1. Start a Pomodoro study session
2. Input notes or study material
3. Generate flashcards automatically
4. Focus during work intervals
5. Review flashcards during breaks
6. Track progress over time

## Future Improvements

- User accounts and cloud sync
- Flashcard difficulty tracking
- Mobile support
- Export flashcards to Anki
- Analytics dashboard for study habits
